existing routes in the routes array.\r\n  1. The `name` key is used for the name of the route on the Navbar.\r\n  2. The `icon` key is used for the icon of the route on the Navbar.\r\n  3. The `collapse` key is used for making a collapsible item on the Navbar that contains other routes\r\n  inside (nested routes), you need to pass the nested routes inside an array as a value for the `collapse` key.\r\n  4. The `route` key is used to store the route location which is used for the react router.\r\n  5. The `href` key is used to store the external links location.\r\n  6. The `component` key is used to store the component of its route.\r\n  7. The `dropdown` key is used to define that the item should open a dropdown for its collapse items .\r\n  8. The `description` key is used to define the description of\r\n          a route under its name.\r\n  9. The `columns` key is used to define that how the content should look inside the dropdown menu as columns,\r\n          you can set the columns amount based on this key.\r\n  10. The `rowsPerColumn` key is used to define that how many rows should be in a column.\r\n*/\r\n\r\n// @mui material components\r\nimport Icon from \"@mui/material/Icon\";\r\n\r\n// @mui icons\r\nimport
